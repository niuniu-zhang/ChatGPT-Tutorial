# ChatGPT Tutorial

This repository contains teaching/reading material on how to effectively use ChatGPT for coding, specifically tailored for high school student coders involved in the [Finiverse project](https://www.finiverse.org/our-mission). Our goal is to teach students to harness the power of AI to enhance their learning and facilitate their contribution towards the completion of the [student loan project](https://www.finiverse.org/college-costs).

## Repository Structure
Within this directory, you'll find individual tutorials addressing various aspects of coding and AI assistance:

- [Java_coding](Java_coding): Demonstrates using ChatGPT for coding in Java, even if you never coded in Java before. This folder includes code examples and specific tutorials.

- [Guides](Guides): A collection of guides addressing common challenges for beginners in Java and other areas.
  - [Git Guide](Guides/GitGuide.md): A tutorial on handling complex git situations with ChatGPT's help.
  - [PostgreSQL](Guides/PostgreSQL.md): Demonstrates using ChatGPT to understand basics of PostgreSQL, emphasizing how to learn new concepts and tools from ChatGPT through Socratic inquiry.
  - [Coding Poet](Guides/CodingPoet.md): A guide on using ChatGPT to write efficient code documentation and comments, enhancing coding skills.

## Contributing to the Finiverse Mission
We encourage contributors to develop materials that align with the Finiverse project's real-world challenges. This approach helps bridge the gap between learning to code and applying those skills to impactful projects, enhancing the educational journey of high school coders.
