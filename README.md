# ChatGPT Tutorial

This repository contains teaching/reading material regarding how to use ChatGPT effectively to boost learning for coding, specifically tailored for high school student coders involved in the [Finiverse project](https://www.finiverse.org/our-mission). Our goal is to teach students to harness the power of AI to enhance their learning and facilitate their contribution towards the completion of the [student loan project](https://www.finiverse.org/college-costs).

## Repository Structure
Within this directory, you'll find individual tutorials that address various questions:

- [Java_coding](Java_coding): Showcases how to use ChatGPT to code in Java without prior knowledge. Inside this folder, you'll find code examples and specific tutorials.
  
- [Guides](Guides): Contains a list of guides that address common problems beginners in Java might encounter.
  - [Git Guide](Guides/GitGuide.md): Learn how to handle tricky git situations with the assistance of ChatGPT.
  - [PostgreSQL](Guides/PostgreSQL.md): Learn the basics of PostgreSQL and how to interact with databases which can be integral for managing financial data within the Finiverse project.

## Contributing to the Finiverse Mission
We align our tutorials and guides with real-world coding challenges, such as those faced by high school students working on financial management tools for the Finiverse project. Contributors are encouraged to develop materials that support and enhance the Finiverse mission, helping to bridge the gap between learning to code and applying those skills to impactful projects.
